# Aurora
 Aurora is my venture into algorithmic trading

## To-Do
- Clean up the plot window
- Chart indicators
- Come up with basic strategy using indicators
- Track P/L from strategy
- Setup frontend & backend to track live
- Figure out how to add in machine learning & statistics

## What I've done so far:
- Connect to Finnhub API
- Request data
- Transform data into DataFrame, & feed it into matplotlib to get a visual plot of the data
